#string vs integer#
#quotation marks give the variables a value of string#

#interger#
$f = 14

#string#
$g = '12'

#the interger comes first in this varible so ps runs addition with the output of //24\\#
#interger // system still completes the math on the two variables#
$d = $f + $g
#\\****$d.gettype()****//#

#the string comes first in this variabl so ps run 12 + (concatenate) 14 with the output of //1214\\#
#****//$j = $g + $f\\****#
#\\****$j.gettype()****//#

#use the //$g | get-member\\ if you want to convert the value to something different  \\look at the to... section for options#

#subtraction works differnetly#
#with the string first outcome for variable is //-2\\ and with gettype command it show its a int32 (integer) #
#\\****$h = $g - $f
#\\****$h.GetType()****//#

#with the interger first the outcome is //2\\and with gettype command it show its a int32 (integer)#
$h = $f - $g
